<h2 id="Who is the founder of cryptocurrency">Who is the founder of cryptocurrency</h2>
Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed Bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation. As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database. Nakamoto was active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010. There has been widespread speculation about Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity, with various people posited as the person or persons behind the name. Though Nakamoto's name is Japanese, and he stated in 2012 that he was a man living in Japan,most of the speculation has involved software and cryptography experts in the United States or Europe.<br>

<p>
    Nakamoto stated that work on the writing of the code for Bitcoin began in the second quarter of 2007.On 18 August 2008, he or a colleague registered the domain name bitcoin.org, and created a web site at that address. On 31 October, Nakamoto published a white paper on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com describing a digital cryptocurrency, titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". On 9 January 2009, Nakamoto released version 0.1 of the Bitcoin software on SourceForge and launched the network by defining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Nakamoto continued to collaborate with other developers on the Bitcoin software until mid-2010, making all modifications to the source code himself. He then gave control of the source code repository and network alert key to Gavin Andresen,transferred several related domains to various prominent members of the bitcoin community, and stopped his recognized involvement in the project.[citation needed] Nakamoto owns between 750,000 and 1,100,000 bitcoin. In November 2021, when Bitcoin hit its still-highest value of over US$68,000, that would have made his net worth up to US$73 billion, making him the 15th-richest person in the world at the time.

<ul>
    <li><h3>Bitcoin</h3></li>
</ul>
The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It's often referred to as digital gold due to its limited supply and store of value properties.<br>
<a href="Images/Bitcoin.png"> <img src="Images/Bitcoin.png"></a><br>
Since its creation in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC 0.15%) has become a revolutionary digital currency. Because it enables peer-to-peer payments without a third party. Some might consider Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency, as a good example of a payment cryptocurrency.

        <li><h3>Ethereum</h3></li>
    </ul>
    This is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum introduced the concept of "smart contracts," which are programmable contracts that self-execute when certain conditions are met. <br>
    <a href="Images/Etherum.png"> <img src="Images/Etherum.png"></a><br>
    Ethereum uses ether, its platform-specific cryptographic token. Ether (ETH) is used to pay validators who stake their coins for their work for the blockchain, The crypto asset that powers the Ethereum blockchain, called Ether (ETH), may be considered an infrastructure cryptocurrency, as it plays a fundamental role in the blockchain.

    Formerly known as Ripple and created in 2012, XRP offers a way to pay in many different real-world currencies. Ripple can be useful in cross-border transactions. XRP, which runs on the Ripple network, has been described as a “<mark>cryptocurrency for banks</mark>” because it's tailor-made to serve the needs of the financial services.

        <li><h3>Litecoin</h3></li>
    </ul>
    Created by Charlie Lee, it's often considered as silver compared to Bitcoin's gold. It has a faster block generation rate and hence offers faster transaction confirmation.<br>
    <a href="Images/Litecoin.png"> <img src="Images/Litecoin.png" width="300" height="300"></a><br>
    Litecoin is both faster and much cheaper than Bitcoin. Litecoin transactions take seconds, like Ethereum transactions. Like many forms of crypto, Litecoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency; it was created from a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain, the transparent, The first and most widely used decentralized ledger currency, with the highest market capitalization as of 2018.

        <li><h3>Transaction Speed</h3></li>
    </ul>
    If you want to send someone money in the United States, there are few ways to move money or assets from one account to another faster than you can with cryptocurrency. Most transactions at U.S. financial institutions settle in three to five days. <mark>A wire transfer usually takes at least 24 hours. Stock trades settle in three days</mark>.

    But one of the advantages of cryptocurrency transactions is that they can be completed in a matter of minutes. Once the block with your transaction in it is confirmed by the network, it's fully settled and the funds are available to use.

<p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Transaction costs</h3></li>
    </ul>
    The cost of transacting in cryptocurrency is relatively low compared to other financial services. For example, it's not uncommon for a domestic wire transfer to cost $25 or $30. Sending money internationally can be even more expensive.

    Cryptocurrency transactions are usually less expensive. However, you should note that demand on the <mark><i>blockchain</i></mark> can increase transaction costs. Even so, median transaction fees remain lower than wire transfer fees even on the most congested blockchains.

        <li><h3>Accessibility</h3></li>
    </ul>
    Anyone can use cryptocurrency. All you need is a computer or smartphone and an internet connection. The process of setting up a cryptocurrency wallet is extremely fast compared to opening an account at a traditional financial institution. There's no ID verification. There's no background or credit check.
    
    Cryptocurrency offers a way for the unbanked to access financial services without having to go through a centralized authority. There are many reasons a person may be unable or unwilling to get a traditional bank account. Using cryptocurrency can allow people who don't use traditional banking services to easily make online transactions or send money to loved ones.

<p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Security</h3></li>
    </ul>
    Unless someone gains access to the private key for your crypto wallet, they cannot sign transactions or access your funds. However, if you lose your private key, there's also no way to recover your funds.

    Furthermore, transactions are secured by the nature of the blockchain system and the distributed network of computers verifying transactions. As more computing power is added to the network, it becomes even more secure.

    Any attack on the network and attempt to modify the blockchain would require enough computing power to confirm multiple blocks before the rest of the network can verify the ledger's accuracy. For popular blockchains such as <b>Bitcoin</b> <mark>(BTC -3.84%)</mark> or <b>Ethereum</b> <mark>(ETH -4.77%)</mark>, that kind of attack is prohibitively expensive.

    Instances of hacked cryptocurrency accounts are usually tied to poor security at a <button><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-are-centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges/" target="_self">centralized exchange</a></button>. If you keep your crypto assets in your own wallet, it's far more secure.<br>

    <ul>
        <li><h2>Privacy</h2></li>
    </ul>
    Since you don't have to register for an account at a financial institution to transact with cryptocurrency, you can maintain a level of privacy. Transactions are pseudonymous, which means you have an identifier on the blockchain -- your wallet address -- but it doesn't include any specific information about you.

    This level of privacy can be desirable in many cases (both innocent and illicit). That said, if someone connects a wallet address with an identity, all of the transaction data is public. There are several ways to further mask transactions, as well as several coins that are privacy-focused to enhance the private nature of cryptocurrency.
